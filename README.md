The idea behind this is to have a simple script that will connect to my YouTube channel and download me a copy of my videos. Videos will be downloaded to videos folder and shorts will be downloaded to a shorts folder. 
I might want to auto post them to other networks and or have a backup. 
I was thinking of having this script run by cron / scheduled tasks once a day. I should keep an inventory of videos so it wont download the same video more then once.
